<summary>Abstract</summary>
A discrete stochastic process which closely follows the mantra repeated during
Covid-19 about how epidemics grow is presented as a childs game of cards.
When the results of multiple games are averaged the resulting difference
equations match the differential equations of the
standard SIR model and thus this minimal model is validated.
Extending to an animal social network formed by voles allows comparison of
results with those of the complete graph of the basic game.
This allows questions to be asked about flattening the curve and seasonality.
A discrete probability distribution for the ratio of growth to exponential growth
is derived and seen to scale to the logit-normal distribution. Correlations for
the moments and underlying mean and standard deviation are then used to create
a stochastic differential equation model.
