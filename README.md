## Epidemiology

[The minimal SIR model, validated then extended to social networks and stochastic differential equations](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/y6ckv_v1)

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
A discrete stochastic process which closely follows the mantra repeated during
Covid-19 about how epidemics grow is presented as a childs game of cards.
When the results of multiple games are averaged the resulting difference
equations match the differential equations of the
standard SIR model and thus this minimal model is validated.
Extending to an animal social network formed by voles allows comparison of
results with those of the complete graph of the basic game.
This allows questions to be asked about flattening the curve and seasonality.
A discrete probability distribution for the ratio of growth to exponential growth
is derived and seen to scale to the logit-normal distribution. Correlations for
the moments and underlying mean and standard deviation are then used to create
a stochastic differential equation model.

## Affine returns

[Affine returns on Bernoulli trials in finance](./affine.pdf)

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
Offset returns of stock price movements were used to model the Paris Bourse in
1900. This first Mathematical model of Brownian motion
was superseded by Geometric Brownian motion in
the 1960s. i.e. the normal distribution was replaced by the log-normal and
offset returns by linear returns. The market crash
of 1998 caused the latter model to be questioned. This paper extends the model
to affine returns, matching the average behaviour seen on the S&P 500
to calculations from averages of the daily ups and downs along with their
probabilities. i.e. expected behaviour to noise.
Affine returns lead to a mixture distribution consisting of two components -
the log-normal distribution and one other which looks like the logit-normal
distribution scaled from [0, 1] to some other finite support.
For the shrinking case it was shown that the distribution was not
parameterisable.

[The affine growth of NBA players and other adults](./nba_heights.pdf)

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
The heights of NBA players form a skewed distribution rather than follow the
normal distribution as the textbooks suggest. There has long been disquiet
around whether the normal is the appropriate distribution with some authors
using the log-normal instead. For Bernoulli trials offset returns are
approximated by the normal distribution, linear returns by the log-normal and
it has been recently shown affine returns may be approximated by an
appropriately scaled logit-normal distribution.
A good fit for the heights of the NBA players is performed by this latter
distribution whose parameters are derived using a mixture of Maximum Likelihood
Estimation and a grid search. Fitting adult heights of the general population
is also undertaken.

[The affine growth of river heights](./river_heights.pdf)

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
River heights form a skewed distribution which is variously fit by the
log-normal, Gamma, Generalized Extreme Value, Weibull and Pareto distributions.
For Bernoulli trials it has been recently shown affine returns may be
approximated by an appropriately scaled logit-normal distribution.
A good fit for some of the river heights is performed by this latter
distribution whose parameters are derived using a mixture of Maximum Likelihood
Estimation and a grid search.

[The affine growth of hurricane speeds](./hurricanes.pdf)

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
Hurricane strengths form a skewed distribution which is variously fit by the
Weibull or log-normal distributions.
For Bernoulli trials it has been recently shown affine returns may be
approximated by an appropriately scaled logit-normal distribution.
A reasonable fit for some of the hurricane strengths is performed by this latter
distribution whose parameters are derived using a mixture of Maximum Likelihood
Estimation and a grid search.

[The affine growth of wave heights](./waves.pdf)

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
Wave heights in oceanography are modelled using the Rayleigh, Weibull,
Generalized Gamma and log-normal distributions.
For Bernoulli trials it has been recently shown affine returns may be
approximated by an appropriately scaled logit-normal distribution.
A good fit for some of the river heights is performed by this latter
distribution whose parameters are derived using a mixture of Maximum Likelihood
Estimation and a grid search.

[The affine growth of wealth](./wealth.pdf)

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
Economists fit both the log-normal and Pareto distributions to wealth depending
on whether they are on the right tail or not.
For Bernoulli trials it has been recently shown affine returns may be
approximated by an appropriately scaled logit-normal distribution.
A good fit for some of the wealth statistics is performed by this latter
distribution whose parameters are derived using a mixture of Maximum Likelihood
Estimation and a grid search.

[The affine growth of insurance premiums](./insurance.pdf)

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
Insurance premiums are modelled using the log-normal, Pareto, Gamma and Weibull
distributions.
For Bernoulli trials it has been recently shown affine returns may be
approximated by an appropriately scaled logit-normal distribution.
A good fit for some of the premiums is performed by this latter
distribution whose parameters are derived using a mixture of Maximum Likelihood
Estimation and a grid search.
