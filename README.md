## Epidemiology

[The minimal SIR model, validated then extended to social networks and stochastic differential equations](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/y6ckv_v1)

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
A discrete stochastic process which closely follows the mantra repeated during
Covid-19 about how epidemics grow is presented as a childs game of cards.
When the results of multiple games are averaged the resulting difference
equations match the differential equations of the
standard SIR model and thus this minimal model is validated.
Extending to an animal social network formed by voles allows comparison of
results with those of the complete graph of the basic game.
This allows questions to be asked about flattening the curve and seasonality.
A discrete probability distribution for the ratio of growth to exponential growth
is derived and seen to scale to the logit-normal distribution. Correlations for
the moments and underlying mean and standard deviation are then used to create
a stochastic differential equation model.

## Finance

[Affine returns on Bernoulli trials in finance](./affine.pdf)

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
Offset returns of stock price movements were used to model the Paris Bourse in
1900. This first Mathematical model of Brownian motion
was superseded by Geometric Brownian motion in
the 1960s. i.e. the normal distribution was replaced by the log-normal and
offset returns by linear returns. The market crash
of 1998 caused the latter model to be questioned. This paper extends the model
to affine returns, matching the average behaviour seen on the S\&P 500
to calculations from averages of the daily ups and downs along with their
probabilities. i.e. expected behaviour to noise.
Affine returns lead to a mixture distribution consisting of two components ---
the log-normal distribution and one other which looks like the logit-normal
distribution scaled from \( \left[0, 1 \right] \) to some other finite support.
For the shrinking case it was shown that the distribution was not
parameterisable.
